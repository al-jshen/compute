## Development Roadmap

This crate is a way for me to learn about computing (with an emphasis on statistics). This means that it is probably not ready to be used in production environments. 

### Currently:
- transition over from `Vec` to ndarray's `Array`
- implement rest of commonly used distributions
- better interface for working with optimizers


### To be implemented:
- generalized linear models
- time series-related functions
- Gaussian processes
- clustering algorithms
- autodiff
- numerical integrators
- more optimizers
- resampling algorithms
- neural networks
