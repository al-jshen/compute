## Planned features

- automatic differentiation (replacing numerical differentiation)
- distributions: CDFs, fitting to data
- more time series models (SARIMA, exponential smoothing models)
- non-linear least squares algorithms (Levenberg-Marquardt)
- ODE integrators (leapfrog, RK4)
- clustering algorithms (k-means/EM, DBSCAN)
- more optimizers (SGD, Adagrad)
- more regression models (GLMs, mixed models, GP, penalized models)
- prediction trees (CART, random forests, gradient boosted trees)
- order statistics (quantiles)
- interpolation (polynomial, spline)
- statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling)
- data preprocessing (outlier detection, standardization, dimensionality reduction (PCA))
- more linear algebra decompositions (QR, SVD, Cholesky)
- samplers: rejection, RWM, HMC, NUTS, (dynamic) nested sampling
