## Planned features
- automatic differentiation (replacing numerical differentiation)
- more time series models (SARIMA, exponential smoothing models)
- non-linear least squares algorithms (Levenberg-Marquardt)
- ODE integrators (leapfrog, RK4)
- clustering algorithms (k-means, DBSCAN)
- more optimizers (SGD, Adagrad)
- more regression models (GLMs, mixed models, GP, penalized models)
- prediction trees (CART, random forests, gradient boosted trees)
- order statistics (quantiles)
- interpolation (polynomial, spline)
